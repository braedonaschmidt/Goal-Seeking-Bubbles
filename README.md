# Goal-Seeking-Bubbles
**Machine learning** bubbles that seek out a goal.\
Based on *Code Bullet's* tutorial. I tried to rely as little as possible on his actual code, but did borrow from it when stuck.

## Description
This is a simple **Processing** project that generates a population of bubbles that try to navigate to a target at the top. It uses the **Genetic Algorithm** to progress, and the fitness is determined by 1 / (distance^2).

## Features I Might Add Later
* **Greater incentives for reaching target quickly** (currently, reaching the target slowly and quickly are treated the same for determining fitness, which could be improved to increase speed)
* **Obstacles**
* **Graphs and other visuals/statistics**
